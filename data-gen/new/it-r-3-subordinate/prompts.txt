1. We will give you examples of English sentences stylized to Italian syntax that follow or violate the rules of a shared grammar, along with labels 'Yes' or 'No'. You will then generate a label, 'Yes' or 'No', for a new unlabeled sentence that may follow or violate the same grammar rules.
2. The nouns in the sentences have specific gender determiners - 'kar' (used by woman, cabinet, fruit, mountain, bulb, pizza, poem, story, cup, bottle, box, hill, pear, staircase, banana, tree, girl); 'kon' (used by rock, mouse, teacher, speaker, man, fish, roof, writer, dog, boy, book, meal, cat, chapter, newspaper, poet, toy, chalk, cap, biscuit, author, cucumber); 'kars' (used by girls, women); 'kons' (used by teachers, boys, dogs, men, writers, speakers, poets, cats, authors).
