1. We will give you examples of English sentences stylized to Italian syntax that follow or violate the rules of a shared grammar, along with labels 'Yes' or 'No'. You will then generate a label, 'Yes' or 'No', for a new unlabeled sentence that may follow or violate the same grammar rules.
2. The nouns in the sentences have specific gender determiners - 'kar' (used by poem, tree, cabinet, pear, woman, banana, pizza, staircase, box, story, bulb, bottle, cup, girl, hill, mountain, fruit); 'kon' (used by author, writer, fish, man, mouse, chalk, toy, poet, chapter, boy, dog, cucumber, rock, cap, cat, newspaper, teacher, meal, speaker, book, biscuit, roof); 'kars' (used by girls, women); 'kons' (used by cats, men, speakers, dogs, authors, boys, poets, teachers, writers).
